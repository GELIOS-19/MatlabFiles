% Since y = s*u + t*v, A*y = A*(s*u + t*v) = A*s*u + A*t*v, and since A*u and A*v are both 0 vectors, multiplying by scalars s and t will still result in the zero vector.

% Question 2 (a) (i) The equation A*x = 0 has no free variables since all of the variables in A are basic variables, in other words A has maximum rank.
% Question 2 (a) (ii) The set S is linearly independent since only a trivial set of coefficients (all 0) will allow for a linear combination that results in the 0 vector. In other words, no vector in the set is in the span of the others.

% Question 2 (b) (i) The equation B*x = 0 has 1 free variable
% Question 2 (b) (ii) The set T is linearly dependent by definition since the vector u4 can be expressed as a linear combination of the other vectors.

v = rand(1)*u1 + rand(1)*u2
v =

% Since v is a linear combination of u1 and u2, a set U = {u1, u2, v} would be linearly dependent since v can be expressed as a linear combination of the other vectors in the set. This means that regardless of the value of v, the fact that it is a linear combination of u1 and u2 means that there are some non-zero coefficients c1, c2, c3 such that the linear combination of these coefficients and the vectors u1, u2, and v will equal 0. Linear independence is defined as when the only linear combination of a set that equals 0 would be when all coefficients are 0. For the set U, this is false therefore the set is linearly dependent.

% As shown above, when a matrix U is augmented with the vectors in set U and then placed into rref, there is a free variable corresponding to the vector v. This means that the set is linearly dependent.
